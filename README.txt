A software and GPU emulated HD output device plugin for VDR.

    o Video decoder CPU / VDPAU
    o Video output VDPAU
    o Audio FFMpeg / Alsa / Analog
    o Audio FFMpeg / Alsa / Digital
    o Audio FFMpeg / OSS / Analog
    o HDMI/SPDIF pass-through
    o Software volume, compression, normalize and channel resample
    o VDR ScaleVideo API
    o Software deinterlacer Bob (VA-API only)
    o Autocrop
    o Grab image (VDPAU only)
    o Suspend / Dettach
    o Letterbox, Stretch and Center cut-out video display modes
    o atmo light support with plugin http://github.com/durchflieger/DFAtmo
    o PIP (Picture-in-Picture) (VDPAU only)

    o planned: Remove VA-API decoder and output support
    o planned: Video decoder OpenMax
    o planned: Video output Opengl / Xv
    o planned: Improved software deinterlacer (yadif or/and ffmpeg filters)
    o XvBa support is no longer planned (use future Radeon UVD VDPAU)

To compile you must have the 'requires' installed.


This is a fork of johns original softhddevice work and I just added support for HEVC VDPAU support.
Currently I have tested it with a GTX 1050 from NVIDIA and a RX 460 from AMD.

Current Status NVIDA:
The NVIDIA driver currently does only support HEVC with 8 Bit. Also the routing of the sound to the HDMI port does not work. 
It always sends the sound to the first port (DVI Port). This seems a problem from alsa. 

Current Status of AMD:
The AMD driver suppports both (8 Bit and 10 Bit) HEVC codecs. But currently FFMEPG does not support the 10 Bit part. With the provided patch "ffmpeg_patch_for_amd.txt" also UHD with 10 Bit will work.
The patch should work with FFmepg 3.2.x
You also have to patch the file video.c and change the output surface to 10 Bit RGB Format around line 6726. Then Autocrop and screen capture will not work anymore:
    //
    //  Create display output surfaces
    //
    // format = VDP_RGBA_FORMAT_B8G8R8A8;
    // FIXME: does a 10bit rgba produce a better output?  
    format = VDP_RGBA_FORMAT_R10G10B10A2;
 

So with NVIDIA cards only DVB-T2 HD can be decoded and with AMD full UHD is working.

You have to adapt the Makefile to your needs. I use FFMPEG 3.2, but I assume 3.1 will also do.

Good luck

Quickstart:
-----------

Just type make and use.

Install:
--------
	1a) git

	git clone git://github.com/jojo61/vdr-plugin-softhddevice.git
